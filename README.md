### Analysis

* Capomulin outperformed Infubinol and Ceftamin by a significant margin. However Ramicane performed slightly better than Capomulin with average tumor size 34.84 as compared to 37.31 of Capomulin

* Mouse s185 treated with Capomulin showed 51% reduction in tumor volume, however a slight increase in tumor volume was observed between 10 and 15 days of the treatment. This might imply minimal treatmeant period necessary to see sustained results.

* Average tumor volume increased exponentially with increase in mouse weight. This might imply need for higher drug dosage with increase in weight.
